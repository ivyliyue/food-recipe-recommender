# food-recipe-recommender

When it comes to making day-to-day decisions such as what to make for dinner, combing through the ingredients leftover in the fridge/pantry and comparing them to a recipe found online is not the easiest. Adding in additional factors like specific diets, and finding a recipe becomes quite difficult. To aid in this, this project is aimed to develop a recipe recommender tailored to millenials with restrictive and creative meal choices, based on a recipe and ingredient/category dataset. Multiple similarity measures were compared to determine the best measure for the k-Nearest Neighbor: Euclidean distance
